    #   randomly, or nil if routing solely using type
    #   :tags(Array):: Tags that must all be associated with a target for it to be selected
    #   :scope(Hash):: Behavior to be used to resolve tag based routing with the following keys:
    #     :account(String):: Restrict to agents with this account id
    # opts(Hash):: Additional send control options
    #   :offline_queueing(Boolean):: Whether to queue request if currently not connected to any
    #     brokers, defaults to false
