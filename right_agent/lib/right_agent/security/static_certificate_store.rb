module RightScale

  # Simple certificate store, serves a static set of certificates
  class StaticCertificateStore
    
    # Initialize store
    #
    # === Parameters
    # signer_certs(Array|Certificate):: Signer certificate(s) used when loading data to
    #   check the digital signature. The signature associated with the serialized data
    #   needs to match with one of the signer certificates for loading to succeed.
    # recipients_certs(Array|Certificate):: Recipient certificate(s) used when serializing
    #   data for encryption. Loading the data can only be done through serializers that
    #   have been initialized with a certificate that's in the recipient certificates
    #   if encryption is enabled.
    def initialize(signer_certs, recipients_certs)
      signer_certs = [ signer_certs ] unless signer_certs.respond_to?(:each)
      @signer_certs = signer_certs 
      recipients_certs = [ recipients_certs ] unless recipients_certs.respond_to?(:each)
      @recipients_certs = recipients_certs
    end
    
    # Retrieve signer certificates
    #
    # === Parameters
    # id(String):: Serialized identity of signer, ignored
    #
    # === Return
    # (Array):: Signer certificates
    def get_signer(id)
      @signer_certs
    end

    # Retrieve recipient certificates that will be able to decrypt the serialized data
    #
    # === Parameters
    # packet(RightScale::Packet):: Packet containing recipient identity, ignored
    #
    # === Return
    # (Array):: Recipient certificates
    def get_recipients(packet)
      @recipients_certs
