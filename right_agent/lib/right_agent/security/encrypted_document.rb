module RightScale

  # Represents a signed an encrypted document that can be later decrypted using
  # the right private key and whose signature can be verified using the right
  # cert.
  # This class can be used both to encrypt and sign data and to then check the
  # signature and decrypt an encrypted document.
  class EncryptedDocument
  
    # Encrypt and sign data using certificate and key pair
    #
    # === Parameters
    # data(String):: Data to be encrypted
    # certs(Array):: Recipient certificates (certificates corresponding to private
    #   keys that may be used to decrypt data)
    # cipher(Cipher):: Cipher used for encryption, AES 256 CBC by default
    def initialize(data, certs, cipher = 'AES-256-CBC')
      cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher::Cipher.new(cipher)
      certs = [ certs ] unless certs.respond_to?(:collect)
      raw_certs = certs.collect { |c| c.raw_cert }
      @pkcs7 = OpenSSL::PKCS7.encrypt(raw_certs, data, cipher, OpenSSL::PKCS7::BINARY)
    end

    # Initialize from encrypted data
    #
    # === Parameters
    # encrypted_data(String):: Encrypted data
    #
    # === Return
    # doc(EncryptedDocument):: Encrypted document
    def self.from_data(encrypted_data)
      doc = EncryptedDocument.allocate
      doc.instance_variable_set(:@pkcs7, RightScale::PKCS7.new(encrypted_data))
      doc
    end
    
    # Encrypted data in PEM (base64) or DER (binary) format
    #
    # === Parameters
    # format(Symbol):: Encode format: :pem or :der, defaults to :pem
    #
    # === Return
    # (String):: Encrypted data
    def encrypted_data(format = :pem)
      format == :pem ? @pkcs7.to_pem : @pkcs7.to_der
    end
    
    # Decrypted data
    #
    # === Parameters
    # key(RsaKeyPair):: Key pair used for decryption
    # cert(Certificate):: Certificate to use for decryption
    #
    # === Return
    # (String):: Decrypted data
    def decrypted_data(key, cert)
      @pkcs7.decrypt(key.raw_key, cert.raw_cert)
