  spec.description = <<-EOF
  RightAgent provides a foundation for running an agent on a server to interface
  in a secure fashion with other agents in the RightScale system. A RightAgent
  uses RabbitMQ as the message bus and the RightScale mapper as the routing node.
  Servers running a RightAgent establish a queue on startup for receiving packets
  routed to it via the mapper. The packets are structured to invoke services in
  the agent represented by actors and methods. The RightAgent may respond to these
  requests with a result packet that the mapper then routes to the originator.
  Similarly a RightAgent can also make requests of other RightAgents in the
