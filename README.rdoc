= RightAgent

= DESCRIPTION

== Synopsis

RightAgent provides a foundation for running an agent on a server to interface
in a secure fashion with other agents in the RightScale system using RightNet,
which operates in either HTTP or AMQP mode. When using HTTP, RightAgent
makes requests to RightApi servers and receives requests using long-polling or
WebSockets via the RightNet router. To respond to requests it posts to the
HTTP router. When using AMQP, RightAgent uses RabbitMQ as the message bus and
the RightNet router as the routing node to make requests; to receives requests
routed to it by the RightNet router, it establishes a queue on startup. The
packets are structured to invoke services in the agent represented by actors
and methods. The RightAgent may respond to these requests with a result packet
that the router then routes to the originator.

Refer to the wiki (https://github.com/rightscale/right_agent/wikis) for up-to-date
documentation.

Also use the built-in issues tracker (https://github.com/rightscale/right_agent/issues)
to report issues.

== Interface

A RightAgent exposes its services via actors and methods that are invoked by requests
packets it receives via its message queue. All RightAgents have a general purpose actor
named agent_manager that provides the following services:

* <b>agent_manager/ping</b>: Respond with basic status information to indicate that active
* <b>agent_manager/stats</b>: Retrieve statistics about agent operation
* <b>agent_manager/set_log_level</b>: Change log level of agent
* <b>agent_manager/execute</b>: Eval code in context of agent
* <b>agent_manager/connect</b>: Connect agent to additional broker or reconnect it to one
* <b>agent_manager/disconnect</b>: Disconnect agent from broker

RightAgent comes with several library modules for forming basic command line tools:

* <b>agent_deployer</b>: Build a configuration file for running the agent (rad tool)
* <b>agent_controller</b>: Manage an agent that has been configured (rnac tool)
* <b>stats_manager</b>: Display operation statistics for an agent (rstat tool)
* <b>log_level_manager</b>: Retrieve and set log level for an agent (rlog tool)

== Supported Configuration

RightAgent has been tested on EC2 instances running CentOS 5.2 and Ubuntu 8.10.

== Work in Progress

RightAgent is work in progress, expect more documentation and examples in the near future.
